iPhone conch simulator


Finally, the long wait for an iOS conch simulator is over! Impress your friends and win over enemies with this no-holds-barred simulation of a human blowing a conch shell with minimal competence. 

Stupid: It measures your breath power. We know you've always wanted to know that, right? Now you can do it on your phone and make a horrible noise at the same time. Lucky you! 

Annoying: You too can be that one at the bar that tries to pick people up with a line about what beautiful music you make when you blow stuff. 

Awesome: It is exactly like being in the Lord of the Flies. Exactly. Awesome, right?
